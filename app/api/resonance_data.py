"""
app/api/resonance_data.py — the data half of the resonance contract.

app/api/resonance.py mounts the panel. This module is what the panel is
allowed to *read* once it is mounted, and it exists because the embed contract
has three parts and mounting only satisfies one of them:

  1. an OpenAPI document at a stable same-origin path      -> /api/resonance/openapi.json
  2. a grant file naming what may be called                -> /.well-known/resonance.json
  3. endpoints that behave: bounded, JSON, stable fields   -> /api/resonance/data/*

Why a separate surface rather than granting against /api/captures/* directly.
The operations named in a grant have to carry a stable operationId, prose a
stranger can choose between, enums for every fixed vocabulary, a declared
response schema, and a bounded page with a total. pktPCAP's own capture list
returns a bare array with no total and no paging, and the same route family
carries download and delete, which must not be reachable from a grant at all.
These wrap the same table instead, so there is no second implementation of any
query — only a second, narrower doorway with the labels the model needs.

Authentication is the app's existing session, not a new one. The panel's calls
are ordinary same-origin fetches from our own page, so they carry the refresh
cookie exactly as /api/resonance/code does, and they are admitted by the same
helpers that admit /code — see resonance_session_user below. Nothing here
issues, accepts or understands a credential of resonance's, and the panel can
therefore only ever read what the signed-in person could already read.

THIS SURFACE IS READ-ONLY, AND UNLIKE THE OTHER PKT APPS IT HAS NO WRITE HALF
AT ALL. That is not an omission: pktPCAP's state-changing endpoints delete a
capture, publish one to other users, or accept an upload, and none of the three
is something an assistant should be able to do. There is no alert engine here
either, so there is nothing to acknowledge.

Nor does anything here return packet data. The assistant can see that a capture
exists, what it was called, how big it is and who made it — the catalogue, not
the contents. A packet capture is the most sensitive artefact this suite holds;
reading one is a deliberate act a person performs by downloading it, and it
stays that way.
