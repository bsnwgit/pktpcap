"""
pktPCAP — Navigation manifest for pktHub's APPS sidebar.

Manifest: GET /api/nav/manifest  → this app's own left-nav, in display order

pktHub mirrors these entries under pktPCAP in its own sidebar and opens each
one as a chromeless embed of the real page (`/proxy/<app_id><path>?chromeless=1`),
so the hub's menu is this app's menu rather than a re-implementation of it.

Keep in step with NAV in frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx — that const is
what this app renders for a direct visit, this manifest is what the hub
renders. Same menu, two consumers: a page added to one belongs in the other.
